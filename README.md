## 🔬 What I Do

I specialize in:

- **3D Object Detection & Multi-Object Tracking** using LiDAR and vision-based sensors
- **Instance & Anomaly Segmentation** with modern architectures like Mask2Former, OneFormer, and SAM
- **Sensor Fusion** across LiDAR, radar, IMU, stereo, and monocular cameras
- **Robotic Motion Planning & Control** on mobile platforms (rovers, robotic arms)
- **Simulation and Digital Twin development** for testing and deployment
- **Edge AI on Embedded Devices** (Jetson, FPGA) with ROS1/2 and ROCK
